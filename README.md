DetectWithNLS.cppipe recognizes nuclear region from nuclear localization signal-fused fluorescence protein (NLS-FP) images. 
3 pixels from the rim of the nuclear region are regarded as the nuclear envelope. More than 10 pixels inside from the rim of nuclear region are regarded as the nucleoplasm.

#When nuclear region cannot be detected properly using NLS-FP images, use the DetectWithNLSMaskWithLamin or DetectWithLamin pipeline to analyze images.
